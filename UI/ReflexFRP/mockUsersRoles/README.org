* Login with server side validation

This repo implements a ui form for server side user validation.

From a technical stanpoint, the aim of this project is to see how various
libraries fit together: =reflex= and =reflex-dom= for the frontend, a simple
=servant= server on the backend, the bridge among the two worlds being made with
=servant-reflex=.

Note the structure of the project: three separate cabal projects are created,
one for the frontend, one for the backend, and one for the API and the shared
datatypes, which is included in the other two.

Also, in the frontend I provided two stack.yaml files. The main one is intended
to be used with =ghc=, it generates the haddocks, behaves well with the tooling
(intero), and builds a standalone desktop app.

The second one, =stack-ghcjs.yaml= compiles the project with =ghcjs=. To call
the stack commands for ghcjs just add the option =--stack-yaml=stack-ghcjs.yaml=.

The build of the server should be just a =stack build=. To build the client:
- =stack build gtk2hs-buildtools alex happy=
- be sure to have the required system libraries (like webkitgtk)
- =stack build= or =stack build --stack-yaml=stack-ghcjs.yaml=

You can also use the =deploy.hs= in the client folder, which compiles the
client, minimizes the generated js, and copies it in the location expected by
the server.
